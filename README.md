# easy-google-project
Odin Project: Create a reasonably accurate representation of the Google home page.

During this project I have developed the ability to populate html elements with content and put those elements more or less where I want them on a web page. This is my second iteration of the project, and while the CSS is definitely sloppy, I am proud of the fact that this turned out reasonably close to the google page and renders properly on multiple hardware platforms and multiple browsers.

While I'm certainly not ready for prime-time, I feel pleased at my progress. I don't think front-end is going to be where my heart finds its home, but I do find it rewarding.
